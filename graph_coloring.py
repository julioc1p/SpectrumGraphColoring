""" A Python Class
    A Python graph class for two Spectrum Graph Coloring problems,
    the Threshold Spectrum Coloring problem and the Chromatic Spectrum
    Coloring problem. This class implements some methods and 
    bounds for these problems.

    "Threshold Spectrum Coloring (TSC) problem":
        Given a graph G and a spectrum of k colors, endowed with
        a k × k matrix W of interferences between them, the goal is to determine
        the minimum threshold t ∈ R ≥0 such that (G, W ) admits a k-coloring c 
        in which the interference at every vertex is at most t.

    "Chromatic Spectrum Coloring (CSC) problem":
        Given a graph G and a spectrum of colors S, endowed with a |S| × |S|
        matrix W of interferences between them, a threshold t ∈ R ≥0 is fixed and 
        the spectrum is let to have as size the number |V (G)| of vertices, the goal
        being to determine the minimum number of colors k ∈ N such that (G, W ) admits
        a k-coloring c in which the interference at every vertex is at most that 
        threshold t.
